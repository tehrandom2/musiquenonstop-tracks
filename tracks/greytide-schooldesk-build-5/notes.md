## Why

I did not render this one for the station: it was made on 2026-10-07 for an earlier tabletop game soundtrack, and I have brought it in under that date, so it is not new. The ask was "bored-lesson groove with clock ticks, pencil taps and a hummed tune" (the build phase): 86 bpm in A minor. The prompt describes laid back bored-lesson groove with clock ticks, pencil taps and ruler twangs as a drum kit and a tune hummed under the breath used as an instrument; I have not heard it, and the numbers below were measured now, on the file as it shipped.

## Prompt

> Laid back bored-lesson groove, clock ticks, pencil taps and ruler twangs as a drum kit, a tune hummed under the breath used as an instrument, plinky toy keyboard, fuzzy round bass, dusty drum machine, last-lesson-of-the-day daydream, good-humoured, 86 bpm, a muted trumpet-like synth and a pencil-tap shuffle, calm and spacious, steady loopable arrangement, instrumental, no vocals, no singing, no speech, no drops, no wobble bass, no build-ups, no aggressive drums, no sub bass, light thin low end, bass in the mid range only

No lyrics recorded: instrumental.

## Measured now, on the shipped file (gate profile mellow: the station's default, not what this track was made against)

| gate | measured | limit | passed |
|---|---|---|---|
| tempo | 84 bpm vs asked 86 | within 4 bpm, folds 0.5 / 2 / 4:3 / 3:4 allowed | yes |
| loudness | -16.4 LUFS as shipped | -16 LUFS within 1 dB | yes |
| peak | -2.89 dBFS decoded | under -1 dBFS | yes |
| silence | longest 0.15 s under -50 dBFS | under 0.5 s | yes |
| brightness | 0.98 % of power above 6 kHz | under 2.5 % (mellow) | yes |
| boominess | 12.38 % below 60 Hz | under 12 % | **NO** |
| onset rate | 3.27 per second | 0.3 to 4.5 | yes |
| loop seam | step 0.41x, tail-head -2.9 dB | step under 4.0x, level within 5.0 dB | yes |

## Checks

not passed against the station's profile: boominess. Reported, not a reason to leave it out: this track shipped before the station existed.

## Backfill

- audio: stream-copied (already 128 kbps CBR), tags stripped
- recipe: `reproducible: false`. The seed and the prompt are recorded; the planner model's audio codes were never kept, so a re-render from them may differ. `recipe_render.py` refuses it.
