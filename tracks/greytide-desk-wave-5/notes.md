## Why

I did not render this one for the station: it was made on 2026-10-06 for an earlier tabletop game soundtrack, and I have brought it in under that date, so it is not new. The ask was "woozy tape-warped analog synth funk" (the wave phase): 91 bpm in C minor. The prompt describes laid back woozy analog synth funk with brush-handle taps, paint-jar clinks and cutting-mat ticks as a drum kit and tape-warped detuned synthesizers drifting slightly out of tune; I have not heard it, and the numbers below were measured now, on the file as it shipped.

## Prompt

> Laid back woozy analog synth funk, brush-handle taps, paint-jar clinks and cutting-mat ticks as a drum kit, tape-warped detuned synthesizers drifting slightly out of tune, vocoder lead used as an instrument, fuzzy round bass, dusty lo-fi drum machine with loose swing, lamp-lit painting desk daydream, good-humoured, 91 bpm, talk-box textures and a wandering analog arpeggio, the same groove with a little more drive and bounce, steady loopable arrangement, instrumental, no vocals, no singing, no speech, no drops, no wobble bass, no build-ups, no aggressive drums, no sub bass, light thin low end, bass in the mid range only

No lyrics recorded: instrumental.

## Measured now, on the shipped file (gate profile mellow: the station's default, not what this track was made against)

## Checks

all automatic checks passed. These are numbers, not hearing: nobody on the machine can hear, the owner listens.

## Backfill

- audio: stream-copied (already 128 kbps CBR), tags stripped
- recipe: `reproducible: false`. The seed and the prompt are recorded; the planner model's audio codes were never kept, so a re-render from them may differ. `recipe_render.py` refuses it.
